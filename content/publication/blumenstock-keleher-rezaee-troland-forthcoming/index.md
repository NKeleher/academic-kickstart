abstract: "We present experimental evidence on the economic impacts of mobile phone access. Our results are based on a randomized control trial in the Philippines, through which 14 isolated and previously unconnected villages were randomly assigned to either receive or not receive a new cellphone tower. Following a pre-analysis plan that focused on 10 pre-speciﬁed outcome indices, we ﬁnd that access to a new mobile phone network increases access and use of communications technology; increases social connections within and between communities; and increases household income and expenditure. However, we ﬁnd no evidence of impacts on impacts on informedness of current events, market access, remittances and risk-sharing, or subjective well being. We speculate that the income and expenditure eﬀects are driven by the improved migration opportunities available to households with mobile phone access."
