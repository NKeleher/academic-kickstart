# Niall's website

This is Niall Keleher's website. Currently hosted on [Netlify](https://nkeleher.netlify.com).

Redirected to live site at: [https://nkeleher.com](https://nkeleher.com).

This site uses the [Academic Theme for Hugo](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/) by [George Cushen](https://georgecushen.com/). The modifications made to the base Academic theme benefited from tips provided by [Tyler Clavelle](https://www.tylerclavelle.com/code/2017/blogdown/) and [Flip Tanedo](https://github.com/fliptanedo/academic-flip).
